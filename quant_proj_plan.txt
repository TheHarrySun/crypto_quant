✅ Top Priority: Time Horizon & Volume-Weighted Momentum
📍 Start Here:
Vary Momentum Lookback Windows

Try short-term (3–6 hours), medium-term (24–72 hours), and long-term (7–30 days).

Compute and backtest Sharpe ratios for each.

🔧 Code-wise: Run a loop over different lookback values in your momentum logic.

Incorporate Volume as a Filter or Weight

High trading volume is often a proxy for attention and conviction.

Two ideas:

Use volume to filter out low-liquidity pairs.

Use volume to weight the signal: e.g., momentum_signal * log(volume).

✅ Next Priority: New Information & Activity
📍 Once You Have a Base Strategy Working:
Use Volume Spikes as a Momentum Amplifier

Define a volume z-score: volume_z = (vol - rolling_mean) / rolling_std.

Add momentum trades only if volume_z > threshold (e.g., >1.5).

🔥 This isolates “informed” momentum.

(Advanced) Scrape or use APIs (e.g., Twitter/X) for sentiment scores

Natural extension of "new info" — but start with on-chain or exchange-based activity like volume, volatility, or funding rates.

✅ Mid Priority: Seasonality / Institutional Timing
Explore Seasonality Effects

Backtest weekdays vs. weekends, or day vs. night:

Retail tends to be more active nights/weekends.

Institutions may dominate U.S./EU trading hours.

Easy test: Split your backtest returns into weekday/weekend or work-hours/off-hours.

Use UTC timestamps to isolate time-of-day patterns

Plot average returns by hour of day to see if momentum is clustered.

✅ Longer-Term: Themes and Technical Mechanics
Cluster Coins by Theme

Group by:

L1 vs L2 vs meme coins

“AI”, “DeFi”, “GameFi”, etc.

Track whether momentum within each theme is stronger than cross-theme.

You could apply a separate momentum strategy per cluster.

Explore Mechanical Rebalancing Effects

Find predictable events (e.g., token unlocks, ETF rebalancing) that could generate flows.

These may be harder to model but are alpha-rich if found.
